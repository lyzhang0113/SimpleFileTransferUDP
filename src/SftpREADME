Note:
    * A detailed plot of different LOSS_RATE and AVERAGE_DELAY settings will be included in a separate PDF file.
    * This file only shows some sample outputs and analysis for simplicity.
    * The sequence number for each packet is added at the front of the data buffer.

Configuration:
    * The server is running on port 9093
    * The filename for input file is "inputfile", and the filename for output file is "outputfile".
    * Each file transfer starts with the packet containing a sequence number equal to 0,
        then this sequence number flips between 0 and 1 in following packets.
    * The maximum data size per packet is set to 512 Bytes, this means that each packet should have exactly 512 Bytes
        of data (513 Bytes if including sequence number).
    * The timeout for the client to wait for a ACK packet is set to 1000ms, after timeout, the client retransmits this
        data packet, up to 5 retries.

********** Test 1: Server and Client on Same Machine **********
Server: Windows Desktop (localhost:9093)
Client: Windoes Desktop (localhost)

Input File:
    A 50 KB size input file is randomly generated using command:
        $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=inputfile bs=50KB count=1

Output File:
    outputfile

Client Command Line:
    $ javac SftpClient.java
    $ java SftpClient localhost

Server Command Line:
    $ javac SftpServer.java
    $ java SftpServer

--- Test 1a: LOSS_RATE = 0.2   and AVERAGE_DELAY = 100   ---
Note:
    LOSS_RATE and AVERAGE_DELAY are added in this test case to simulate real-world network conditions,
    as the server and the client are running at the same machine in this test case.

    sFTP: file received successfully from 127.0.0.1 with total size of 50000 bytes
          [C:\Users\zly20\IdeaProjects\SimpleFileTransferUDP\outputfile]


Analysis:
    The 50-KB file is divided into 98 packets, each has a size of 512 Bytes, with the last one having 336 Bytes.
    The server intentionally dropped 26 packets, and the average delay for each ACK is set to 100ms.
    Under this setting, the 50-KB file is transmitted from the client to the server in 36 seconds.
    The file is then checked and verified using the command:
        $ cmp inputfile outputfile
    As no different byte is printed in the console, these two files are identical.

********** Test 2: Server and Client on Different Machine in Different Networks **********
Server: Windows Desktop on Spectrum Network (67.240.61.49:9093)
Client: Android Phone on T-Mobile Network (6.139.162.182)

Note:
    * Because the server is hidden behind a NAT table, port forwarding is enabled in home
        router in order for the client to reach the server.
    * My android phone has an emulated linux environment, therefore I can run linux commands
        on it as well as compiling and running Java applications.

Input File:
    A 50 KB size input file is randomly generated using command:
        $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=inputfile bs=50KB count=1

Output File:
    outputfile

Client Command Line:
