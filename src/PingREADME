Note:
    * The client sends out 10 ping requests successively in each test.
    * The timeout on socket is set to 1 second.
    * Each ping request contains a 56 bytes random generated data (readable characters), this data
        is checked for integrity in response to prevent errors in transmission.

Analysis:
    The average rtt in this case is 1.120ms with no timeouts, however, the first response took noticeably longer
    compared to others. One assumption for this phenomenon is that the first connection takes a longer time to establish.

Analysis:
    The average rtt in this case is 114.175ms (excluding timeouts), and 5 packets are considered lost (dropped
        intentionally by server).


********** Test 3: Server and Client on Different Machine in Different Networks **********
Server: Windows Desktop on Spectrum Network (67.240.61.49:8001)
Client: Android Phone on T-Mobile Network (6.139.162.182)

Note: Because the server is hidden behind a NAT table, port forwarding is enabled in home
    router in order for the client to reach the server.
